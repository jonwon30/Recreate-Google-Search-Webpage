# Recreate Google Search Webpage
 as per the Name of the title
Create without images of any kind, still to create the responsive design aspects and add the picture ::before and ::after the input tag.
The image before the Carbon text, I intend to change to a .png image so it's transparant.

The font family is a google owned font and can't be used, though i think i've found the closest match to it without resorting to an image.

Will finish this off once I figure out how to re-create the 2nd button affect, for now it has a basic JQuery script.
